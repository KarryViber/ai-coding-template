npm run dev
```

## Structure

## Notes

- Prototype / hackathon — prioritize speed
- Keep it simple, ship fast
- Refactor later if it survives

---

## AI Collaboration Rules

### Workflow

- Explain approach briefly, then code — don't overthink for prototypes
- After writing code: quick self-review, make sure it runs
- Proactively flag obvious issues

### Code Style

- Minimal comments
- Don't over-engineer — this is a prototype
- Don't touch code I didn't ask you to change

### Git

- Commit directly to main
- Don't auto-commit — ask me first
- Conventional commits with emoji

### Debugging

- Before fixing: explain root cause briefly
- Verify through actual user flow
- If bug reappears, check original diagnosis

### Verification

After every fix:
1. Verify it works
2. Test the failing scenario
3. Confirm expected behavior
