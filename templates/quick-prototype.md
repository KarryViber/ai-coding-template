## Notes

- This is a prototype / hackathon project
- Prioritize speed over perfection
- Keep it simple, ship fast

## Debugging Rules

- Before fixing a bug, explain: 1) Root cause 2) How the fix addresses it 3) How to verify
- Verify fixes through **complete user flows**, not just the specific code change
- If a bug "reappears" after fixing, investigate whether the original diagnosis was correct
